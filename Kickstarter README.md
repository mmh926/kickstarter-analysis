# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
 -The projects overview is to identify how other campaigns fared in relation to the "Fever" campaign.

### Purpose
 -The purpose is to provide data analysis and visualize how different campaigns fared in relation to their start dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
 -The analysis and challenges were to provide two visual technical analyses charts and a written analysis. The two charts were of "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" and "Outcomes Based on Goals" and included using images and links to the Excel file to code. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 -The analysis required performing a pivot table filtering on the Parent Category, "Theater". Then sorting the campaign outcomes. Next, I created a line chart to visualize the relationship between outcomes and the launch month, then saved it to the Resources folder.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
-The analysis required creating an Excel spreadsheet, utilizing the "COUNTIFS" command to collect outcome and goal data for the "plays" subcategory. Next, I created a line chart titled "Outcomes_vs_Goals.png" in the Resources folder. This chart visualized the relationship between the goal-amount ranges and the percentage of successful, fail, or canceled projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
 -The challenge I ran into was making sure the "Year" column populated to all of the cells when utilizing the auto fill feature.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
###The two conclusions I drew about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart and table were, one, there is a similar correlation between the number of successful and failed outcomes. For example, when the number of successful outcomes increased, so did the number of failed outcomes. The second conclusion was that the best possible launch month(s) appear to be May and June.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
###With the Outcomes Based on Goals chart and file, I concluded that the conclusion that the percentage of successful outcomes dropped when the goal was between $25,000-$34999. The best goal to aim for, that had successful outcomes and least failed outcomes, was "Less than $1000".

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
###The limitations of this dataset are that the charts only looked at months, ignoring years.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
###A possible table or graph that we could create would be a table filtered by year, then month.
